%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Random Forests (RF; Breiman 2001) were employed in this study as non-linear 
%counterparts to the CAP classifiers described above. 
%RF were fitted using the same data set and evaluated similarly to estimate reclassification accuracies,
%construct confusion matrices using out-of-bag error rates (OOB-CV) and assess statistical
%significance using PCC. 
%This allowed a comparison of the results and performance of the two distinct methods
%for modeling vertebrae microchemistry data and the selection of the most accurate
%classifier to employ for habitat discrimination (Mercier et al. 2011)

% -----NOTES:----- (by David L. Jones)
% Used standardized variables (stnd = 1) to create a RF for DISCRIMINATION and
% assessing variable importance; use centered data (stnd = 2) to create a RF for
% CLASSIFYING unknowns.
